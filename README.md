Title of the Project:
Number Guessing Game

Short Description of the Project:
We will be building a mobile game that will have the user guess a number between 1 and X. X will be determined by the game difficulty selected by the user; 10 for easy mode, 100 for medium mode and 1000 for hard mode. Upon choosing the difficulty the user will be asked for the amount of attempts they will have to guess the number correctly, the game will count how many attempts it took for the user to guess the number correctly. Once they guess correctly the user will be congratulated and they will be asked for their name which will be added to a leaderboard that shows the difficulty and amount of guesses they needed. The user’s score of how many times they’ve guessed the number correctly will be displayed after the game ends.


Functional Requirements:

●	The user will be greeted with a title screen where they can press the play button to choose a difficulty or press leaderboard to view the leaderboard
●	The user will be able to choose between three difficulties that affect the number range they will have to guess from:
  ○	Easy (1-10)
  ○	Medium (1-100)
  ○	Hard (1-1000)
●	The user will be able to choose between three leaderboards to view, one for each of the three difficulty levels
●	The leaderboards generated by the app will show the name and the amount of guesses needed (ordered by lowest guesses needed)
●	The user will be able to choose the number of attempts they have to guess the number, regardless of difficulty
●	The app will generate a random number for the user to guess within the bounds set by the difficulty
●	The user will be able to input a number in order to guess the number that the game randomly selects
●	The user will be given a hint after each wrong guess they give to guide them (higher, lower, etc)
●	The app will keep track of how many guesses they have left
●	The app will tell the congratulate the user and show how many guesses it took the user to guess the number correctly upon getting the number right
●	The user will be able to enter their name after winning the game
●	The user's score of how many times they have guessed the number correctly will be displayed after the game ends
